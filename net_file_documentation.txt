FAULT DATA COLUMNS

1: Branch number
2: Short circuit location, given by a number between 0 and 1. In the case of a short-circuit,
	the line impedance ZL is divided in two parts: one connecting to the "from" bus with magnitude a*ZL and
	the other connected to the "to" bus with magnitude (1-a)*ZL.
3: Opening time. Time in seconds that the relay will remain open before the line is removed.
