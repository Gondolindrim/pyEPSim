BUS DATA COLUMNS:

01 Name (S)* 
	- A human-readable name that defines the bus.
	- Must be unique.
02 Load flow area number (I)
	- Used to calculate power indexes by area.
03 Loss zone number (I)
	- Like load flow area, used to calculate area power indexes.
04 Type (S)*
	- Defines the bus type in power flow simulations.
		(1) PQ - Active and reactive bus injections are fixed; voltage is a variable
		(2) PV - Active power bus injection and bus voltage is fixed; reactive power bus injection is a variable
		(3) VT - Bus voltage magnitude and angle are fixed; active and reactive bus power injections are variable (must always have one)
		(4) PdQ - Active power injection is fixed, reactive power injection is calculated according to "perfect" Droop; voltage magnitude is variable
			* Buses of this type have to be attached to a generator
			* The sharing coefficient (beta) for the reactive "perfect" Droop will be calculated using the generators rated active power (generator data column 07)
			* If after power flow the generator reactive power generation is higher than the maximum defined (generator data column 04) or less than the minimum (generator data column 05), generator reactive generation is fixed at the maximum or minimum and the generator is removed from the reactive Droop pool.
		(5) dPQ - Active and reactive power injections are calculated according to "perfect" Droop; volage magnitude is variable
			* Buses of this type must be attached to a generator
			* The sharing coefficients for active Droop (alpha) and "perfect" reactive (beta) will be calculated using the generators ratead active and reactive powers (generator data columns 07 and 08)
			* If after power flow the generator reactive power generation is higher than the maximum defined (generator data column 04) or less than the minimum (generator data column 05), generator reactive generation is fixed at the maximum or minimum and the generator is removed from the reactive Droop pool.
 			* Just like reactive power, if after power flow the generator active power generation is higher than the maximum defined (generator data column 06) or less than the minimum (generator data column 07), generator active generation is fixed at the maximum or minimum and the generator is removed from the active Droop pool.
		(6) PLQ - Active power injection is fixed, reactive power injection is calculated according to a "linear" Droop; voltage magnitude is variable
			* Buses of this type have to be attached to a generator
			* Five parameters are needed and used:
				> Q0 and V0 being the reference voltage-reactive point. Q0 is adopted as the reactive power generation set in generator data, column 03. V0 is adopted as voltage magnitude reference in column 06 of generator data
				> Linear coefficient: defined in generator data, column 12
				> Maximum and minimum reactive power: defined in generator data columns 04 and 05
		(7) LPQ - Active power is calculated by a perfect Droop while reactive power is calculated through a "linear" Q-V voltage Droop curve; voltage is variable
				> Due to the nature of active power and rotor speed interaction, a linear active Droop scheme will become a perfect Droop; hence the only parameter needed for active linear Droop is the same as perfect active droop: the rated active power (generator data column 09), from which the active power sharing coefficient alpha is calcualted
				> For the reactive "linear" Droop, five parameters are needed:
					>> Q0 and V0 being the reference voltage-reactive point. Q0 is adopted as the reactive power generation set in generator data, column 03. V0 is adopted as voltage magnitude reference in column 06 of generator data
					>> Linear coefficient: defined in generator data, column 12

GENERATOR DATA COLUMNS
	- These data are used in static (power flow and state estimation) procedures. Some of the data is used in dynamic simulations.
	- Generally in power flow simulations, buses to which generators are attached are 'PV' type. However, for some generator cases, like synchronous condensers, the 'PQ' type might come in hand at the expense of voltage control. The bus type adopted should be defined in the bus data section.
		* In PV type buses, the P injection value adopted will be the difference between generated active power (generator data column 02) and bus active load (bus data column 07). The voltage magnitude value adopted will be the generator voltage setpoint (generator column data 08)
		* In PQ type buses, P and Q injection values are adopted as the difference between generated powers (generated data columns 02 and 03) and active load values (bus data columns 07 and 08). The voltage magnitude will be set by the power flow algorithm.
