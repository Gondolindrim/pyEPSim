FAULT DATA COLUMNS

1: Branch number (by order of input), beggining with 0 (I)
2: Short circuit location, given by a number between 0 and 1 (F). In the case of a short-circuit,
	the line impedance ZL is divided in two parts: one connecting to the "from" bus with magnitude a*ZL and
	the other connected to the "to" bus with magnitude (1-a)*ZL.
3: Opening time in seconds (F). Time in seconds that the relay will remain open before the line is removed. Opening time is generally under 0.5 seconds and critical opening times are generally 0.1-0.3 seconds.
